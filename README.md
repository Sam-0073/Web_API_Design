- **Monitoring & Diagnostics**: Utilizes Azure Application Insights for monitoring API performance and tracking key metrics, including response times and error rates.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Azure Functions**
- **JavaScript/Node.js**
- **Application Insights** for monitoring
- **Visual Studio Code** for development
- **GitHub** for version control

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building, deploying, and managing a scalable and responsive API on the cloud, providing insight into the practical aspects of Web API design and monitoring.
